# Archived legacy (DB-first reset 2026-02-09)

Legacy multi-service backend code was **already removed** in a prior monolith reset. There is no code in this archive.

- **Previously removed:** `backend/services/gateway`, `backend/services/user-service`, `backend/services/audition-service`, `backend/services/media-service`, `backend/libs/common-runtime`, `backend/libs/common-contract`.
- **Current build:** Single backend at `backend/` only; no references to `services/` or `libs/`.
- **CI/Railway:** Must use root directory `backend` and build command `chmod +x mvnw && ./mvnw -DskipTests package`. Do not point to any path under `services/` or `libs/`.

This folder exists to satisfy the two-stage delete documentation; no further deletion is required.
